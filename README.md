## Challenge Description
The goal is to design a dashboard that displays users based on their social reputation within a community.The dashboard should show the most active and influential members and allow users to follow them. The reputation rankings should be transparent, and the user interface should clearly explain the criteria and weighting used to generate them.

## Proposed solution:
Our proposed solution is a Web 3 app dashboard. We designed a dashboard which spools data via chains/pipelines to generate analytics and insights using Subsquid. Our solution focuses on building a design which can display users based on their reputation rankings. 

#### The project deliverables:
1. The web 3 app dashboard. 
2. A landing page for the product.
3. Documentation of the product. 

## About product

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
